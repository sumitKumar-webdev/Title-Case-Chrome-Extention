UPPERCASE

lowercase

Title Case

Keyboard & Context Menu Support
Use custom shortcuts or right-click on your selection to instantly apply your chosen case.

On-Device Only
All transformations happen locally in your browser—no data is sent to external servers.

🧩 How It Works

Replaces the original selection in-place

No backend, no tracking—just clean, on-device text conversion.
